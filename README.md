# 1. View Json Path in Breadcrumbs
The easiest way to see the path in real-time is by enabling breadcrumbs:     
Go to File > Settings (or IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences on macOS) > Editor > General > Breadcrumbs.     
Ensure the Show breadcrumbs checkbox is selected and the language is set to include JSON.      
You can choose to place the breadcrumbs at the Top or Bottom of the editor window.      
Once enabled, the path to the current JSON element under your cursor will be displayed in the breadcrumb navigation bar.
